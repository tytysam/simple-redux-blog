# Redux Blog App

Simple react-based app that retrieves JSON data from jsonPlaceholder.typicode. This fake API data is then used to propagate mock blog posts, which display in a list on-screen. My goal in building this project was to gain practice using Redux for Global State Management.

In building this app, I was able to gain a deeper understanding of the following:

- Planning a Redux Project
- Building reducers
- Wiring up Providers
- The Connect Function
- Configuring Connect with MapStateToProps

- Redux Thunk and why we need it...
- Tricking Redux with Dummy Reducers
- Fetching data in a Redux App
- Making requests from an action creator
- Understanding (deeply) async action creators
- Middlewares in Redux
- Shortened Syntax with Redux Thunk

- Pure Reducers
- Edge cases re: mutating a Reducer's input state argument
- Safe State Updates in Reducers
- Equality of Arrays and Objects
- Switch Statements inside Reducers
- Extracting logic to mapStateToProps
- Memoizing Functions
- Action Creators inside of Action Creators!
